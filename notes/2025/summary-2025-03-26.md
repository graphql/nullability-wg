# Meeting Summary for Client Controlled Nullability

- Meeting start: 2025-03-26T18:58:56Z
- Meeting end: 2025-03-26T20:06:36Z
- Summary start: 2025-03-26T19:01:55Z
- Summary end: 2025-03-26T20:06:33Z

The meeting focused on discussing experimental features in GraphQL, particularly semantic nullability support across various implementations. The group explored different approaches to disable error propagation and handle non-null fields, considering the impact on existing schemas and legacy clients. They also debated the intuitiveness of GraphQL's nullable-by-default approach and discussed potential changes for future versions, agreeing to review new proposals and push for consensus in the upcoming working group meeting.

## Next Steps

- Benjie to update the Graphql Js pull request with the latest changes for solution one.
- Benjie to review Lee's new proposal and write down concerns in a comment.
- All attendees to read through Lee's new proposal before the next Graphql working group meeting.
- Alex to allocate approximately 40 minutes in the next working group meeting to settle the nullability discussion.
- Benjie to update the error handling proposal to use "errors" instead of "error behavior" with options: propagate, null, and abort.
- Alex to present the consensus from this meeting to the main working group and initiate an elimination discussion and vote on remaining proposals.
- Martin to consolidate semantic nullability implementations in Jordan's repo (if Jordan agrees).
- Benjie to update documentation and advice for solution one to reflect the current representation.

## Summary

### GraphQL Code Generator Semantic Nullability

Martin provides an update on the state of experimental features, focusing on semantic nullability support across various GraphQL implementations. He mentions that GraphQL Code Generator now supports semantic nullability, which is considered a significant milestone. Benjie shares that he has done additional research on server support for nullability and has updated his blog post with this information. The group discusses consolidating information about semantic nullability implementations in Jordan's repository. Alex acknowledges the progress and expresses interest in Benjie's new proposal, which Benjie clarifies is a reinterpretation of the original solution rather than an entirely new approach.

### GraphQL Non-Null Transition Discussion

Benjie discussed the future of GraphQL, emphasizing the need for semantic non-null types and the disabling of null bubbling. He proposed a transitional non-null approach to support legacy clients during the transition to the new behavior. Alex and Calvin clarified that with error bubbling disabled, there is no difference between strict and semantic non-null. The team agreed to further discuss the mechanism for disabling error propagation and its implications for future schema development.

### GraphQL Error Propagation Approaches

The group discusses two approaches to disable error propagation in GraphQL: using a directive in the query document or adding a parameter to the request object. Benjie proposes adding an "error behavior" parameter to the request object, which would allow clients to specify whether they want error propagation, null values, or request abortion. This approach would not require modifying query documents and could be easily implemented in future GraphQL versions. Martin expresses concerns about client-side query transformation, as it may cause inconsistencies between different platforms. The discussion highlights the trade-offs between the two approaches and their potential impact on client implementations and future GraphQL specifications.

### Graphql System Changes and Non-Null Syntax

In the meeting, Martin and Alex discussed the potential changes to the Graphql system, including the possibility of adding a request parameter to manipulate the request as it goes out. Benjie suggested that the future of Graphql should look like its current state, with no extra directives or types. He proposed a transitional non-null solution for existing schemas with legacy clients, while encouraging new schemas to use the non-null syntax. Alex raised a question about the handling of legacy clients, and Benjie clarified that new fields should use the true nullability, while existing nullable fields should be treated as semantically non-nullable.

### GraphQL Non-Null Field Proposal Discussion

Benjie and Martin discuss Lee's recent proposal for handling non-null fields in GraphQL. Benjie explains that Lee's approach is similar to his own proposal from over a year ago, but with different phrasing and implementation. The key difference is that Lee suggests changing introspection to mark fields as non-null by default, with a directive to indicate which fields should bubble errors. Benjie expresses some concerns about this approach, particularly regarding its compatibility with existing tooling and its handling of errors in lists. The group agrees that they need to review Lee's proposal in more detail before the upcoming working group meeting.

### GraphQL's Nullable-by-Default Syntax Debate

Calvin and Martin discuss the intuitiveness of GraphQL's nullable-by-default approach, with Calvin finding it intuitive due to his Swift background. Martin notes that many developers, especially those not working with GraphQL daily, find this surprising. Benjie explains the historical context, comparing it to SQL's approach, and suggests that changing this would be a significant shift better suited for a potential GraphQL 2.0. The group debates the pros and cons of changing the syntax, considering the impact on executable documents and the value it would bring to users.

### GraphQL Nullability Proposals Discussion

The group discusses various proposals for addressing nullability in GraphQL, with Benjie suggesting that solution one is likely the best option. Alex proposes pushing for consensus at the next working group meeting, as there seems to be agreement among those present. Martin abandons his support for solution 5, and Alex drops solution 4. The group agrees to review Lee's new proposal before the next meeting. They also discuss the possibility of including nullability changes in the upcoming July spec release, with Benjie suggesting they might delay the release to include these changes if they are close to being finalized.
