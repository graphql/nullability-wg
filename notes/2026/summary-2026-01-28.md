Martin and Alexander discussed the implementation of a new nullability solution for GraphQL that involves disabling null propagation and using an error parameter for handling inline errors, with the working group reaching consensus on these changes despite minor syntax concerns. They reviewed the next steps for service capabilities and feature discovery, with Martin confirming general agreement on the additions and suggesting the working group be archived after the next main session. The discussion concluded with updates on GraphQL developments, including upcoming releases and a conference in Menlo Park, with Alexander confirming his support for the discussed items and encouragement to submit a talk.

## Next Steps

- Alexander: Attend the main working group meeting and vote in favor of the service capabilities and nullability changes.
- Alexander: Consider submitting a talk for the GraphQL conference in Menlo Park in May.
- Alexander: Attend the GraphQL conference in Menlo Park in May if possible.

## Summary

### GraphQL Nullability Solution Implementation

Martin and Alexander discussed the implementation of a new solution for nullability in GraphQL, which involves disabling null propagation and using a new request parameter called "error" to handle inline errors. They agreed that this approach is simple and avoids breaking changes, though it still requires clients to be aware of server capabilities. Martin explained that the next steps involve implementing service capabilities for feature discovery and then merging the error parameter, which will likely be presented and approved in stages.

### Working Group Consensus and Dissolution

The working group reached consensus on their discussions, with only minor concerns about syntax for displaying capabilities in SDL. Martin confirmed there was general agreement on the additions, likely due to previous discussions in the group. Alexander inquired about dissolving the working group, to which Martin suggested archiving the repository and canceling future meetings during the next main working group session.

### GraphQL Development and Conference Planning

Martin and Alexander discussed the progress and upcoming developments in GraphQL, including the consensus on various topics like GraphQL over HTTP and yearly release cadences for the main spec. They agreed to attend the main working group meeting, with Alexander confirming he would vote in favor of the discussed items. They also talked about the upcoming GraphQL conference in Menlo Park hosted by Meta, with Martin encouraging Alexander to submit a talk and attend the event.
