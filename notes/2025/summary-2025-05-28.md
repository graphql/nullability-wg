The team met to prepare for an upcoming working group session, focusing on aligning their message and discussing implementation approaches for GraphQL features including error propagation, service capabilities, and feature discovery. The group explored various technical solutions and naming conventions for these features while considering backward compatibility and client compatibility requirements. They concluded by discussing proposals for handling non-null types and agreed to continue refining the specifications at the next meeting on the 5th.

## Next Steps

- Benjie to present the latest version of the service capabilities proposal at the next working group meeting.
- Alexander to review the service capabilities proposal and provide feedback before the next working group meeting.
- Benjie to update the service capabilities proposal by removing specific points about GraphQL over HTTP and considering loosening the capability identifier requirements.
- All team members to prepare for discussing the semantic nullability and error propagation proposals at the next working group meeting on the 5th.
- Alexander to review the semantic nullability and error propagation proposals before the next working group meeting.

## Summary

### Working Group Presentation Strategy Meeting

The meeting focused on preparing for the upcoming working group session next Thursday. Martin shared GitHub links for review and emphasized the importance of presenting a simple message to the group, as he believes this approach has a better chance of being accepted. Alexander and Benjie were present, and Martin mentioned that Benjie had just joined the meeting. The group agreed to use this time to discuss their approach and align on their message before presenting it to the larger working group.

### GraphQL Error Propagation Implementation

The team discussed the implementation of error propagation and service capabilities in GraphQL. Benjie explained that Lee suggested using a key-value store to indicate features not specified in the type system, as error behavior is a runtime or service feature rather than a schema feature. Martin expressed concern about the timeline, noting that extensive community input would be needed, potentially delaying implementation. The team considered the possibility of rolling out capabilities after error propagation, but Benjie emphasized that tools would struggle to infer modes without schema-based capabilities.

### GraphQL Error Handling Implementation

Benjie and Alexander discussed the implementation of error handling in GraphQL, focusing on the challenges of configuring and discovering error behavior in schemas. They explored the potential for clients like Relay to automatically utilize new error handling capabilities without requiring user intervention, while also addressing concerns about server compatibility and the need for a standardized way to indicate error mode. The conversation highlighted the importance of maintaining backward compatibility and the need for a method to signal error handling features to clients without breaking existing requests.

### GraphQL Feature Discovery Proposal

The group discussed a proposal for feature discovery in GraphQL, with Benjie explaining that while the proposal was not expected to be contentious, it might require further discussion at the working group. They explored various use cases for feature discovery, including websocket support, transport protocols, environment indicators, and experimental features. Alexander expressed skepticism about the proposal's ease of acceptance, but agreed to present it to the working group for consideration.

### Service Capabilities and Feature Discovery

The team discussed implementing service capabilities and feature discovery using a Google Doc for collaboration. Benjie explained that values in the system can be optional, acting as truthy flags, and demonstrated this by showing how null values can be used in queries and mutations over websockets. Martin and Alexander reviewed the specification changes, with Martin recalling that operation descriptions also require a syntax change.

### GraphQL Capability Naming Standards

The team discussed the structure and naming conventions for GraphQL service capabilities, with Benjie proposing a flexible approach that allows for future expansion while maintaining compatibility with existing implementations. They agreed to loosen the restrictions on capability identifiers, focusing on reserved prefixes rather than strict syntax rules, and decided to remove transport-related specifications from the document. The group also aligned on error propagation behavior, confirming that clients should not include errors in requests and servers should ignore or reject unknown capabilities.

### GraphQL Non-Null Type Proposals

The working group discussed proposals for handling non-null types in GraphQL, focusing on directives like @propagateError and @noPropagate. Benjie expressed that the current semantic non-null directive is sufficient for most users and suggested prioritizing the long-term vision for GraphQL over transitional support. The group considered adding an appendix to clarify the transitional nature of certain proposals, with Martin and Alexander agreeing to further explore implementation details. They planned to continue discussions at the next meeting on the 5th, aiming to finalize the spec edits and address any overflow from previous meetings.
