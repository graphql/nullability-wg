# Nullability WG — April 2025

The Nullability WG (Working Group) is a subcommittee of the GraphQL Spec WG
tasked with improving the experience around nullability in GraphQL. It was
previously known as the Client Controlled Nullability WG, but now includes
server-side solutions within its scope also.
